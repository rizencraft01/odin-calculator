THe purpose of this project is to create a basic calculator that can be used in a browser. 

The skills demonstrated are a basic understanding of the docudocument object model (DOM), JavaScript events, JavaScript basics, and CSS basics.

**Note**: Calculations are intended to be done by clicking on the number and sign buttons on the calculator. Keyboard and decimals are not fully supported, and you might get an unintended result because of that.
